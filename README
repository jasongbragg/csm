Cryptic Speciation Models

This package performs simulations of evolutionary radiations, along with traits evolving under Brownian motion. 'Cryptic species' can then be identified, where trait differences between lineages are less than a designated threshold.

Simulations of the diversification process are based on a protracted birth-death model (see Etienne & Rosindell 2012, Systematic Biology 61, doi:10.1093/sysbio/syr091). In addition, character states for a number of traits evolve by Brownian motion in each lineage. However, the evolution of traits in nascent species is linked (strongly or weakly, depending on the value of a parameter) to trait evolution in their parent species. This leads to a measure of synchronization in trait evolution between the parent and child species, reflecting some remaining connection by gene flow, following population divergence.
